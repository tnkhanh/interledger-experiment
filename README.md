# Experiment on Interledger

Nodes run in docker. Make sure you have permission, best is adding your username to docker group.
- Run with
```
source setup.sh
./exp.py
```

- You can check balance 
```
./print-balance.sh
```
- If balance gets too low or too high, things will fail.


- Shut down the nodes with
```
./stop-nodes.sh
```
